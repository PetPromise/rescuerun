<h1>
    What is the Rescue Run?
</h1>
<p>
The PetPromise Rescue Run is a 5K run/walk and
festival held annually on Memorial Day weekend at
McFerson Commons park in the Arena District. It
promotes awareness of the pet overpopulation problem
and supports efforts to change the future for all
homeless pets through education, rescue,
sterilization, and adoption.
</p>
<h2>
    Please be sure to visit our sponsors.
</h2>
<p>
These companies care about homeless animals in our
community. Our sponsors underwrite all of the event's
expenses. In appreciation of their support and
concern for animals, we encourage you to frequent
their businesses.
</p>
<h2>
    Your entry fees and pledges make a difference for
    homeless pets!
</h2>
<p>
Each year PetPromise rescues and provides food and
medical care to hundreds of homeless, unwanted, and
abused dogs and cats. For most of these animals,
PetPromise is thier last hope. Your entry fee and
pledges will help give homeless pets a second chance.
