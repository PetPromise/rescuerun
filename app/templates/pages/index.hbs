<h1> What is the Rescue Run?</h1>
<p>
    The PetPromise Rescue Run is a 5K run/walk and festival held annually on Memorial Day weekend at McFerson Commons park in the Arena District. It promotes awareness of the pet overpopulation problem and supports efforts to change the future for all homeless pets through education, rescue, sterilization, and adoption.
