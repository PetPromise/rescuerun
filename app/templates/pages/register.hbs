</p>

<h3>I plan to raise funds in addition to my registration fee</h3>

<p>
    Set up your own online fundraising page on <a href="http://www.firstgiving.com/rescuerun/{{ year }}">Firstgiving</a>. We encourage you to take advantage of this great fundraising tool and create a personal web page to help raise money online for the homeless animals in our community. You can also start a team fundraising page.
</p>
<p>
    You may also round up pledges by printing the <a href="documents/{{ year }}-registration-brochure.pdf" target="_blank">race brochure</a>. Invite your friends, family, neighbors, classmates, and co-workers to support PetPromise and our fight to help homeless animals throughout central Ohio by sponsoring you in the Rescue Run. Collect at least $30 in pledges and your entry fee is waived! Fundraising prizes are based on monies raised.
</p>

<h3>I am not collecting pledges, just paying for registration and running/walking myself</h3>
<p>
    You may pre-register either <a href="https://www.premierraces.com/registration/register_step1.asp?eventID=1006">online at Premier Sports</a> or by priniting the race brochure (coming soon) and mailing it on or before May 15, 2013.
